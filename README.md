## Traffic Accident Data Analysis 

## Description:

Analyze traffic accident data to uncover patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day. Visualize accident hotspots and explore contributing factors using Python and data visualization libraries.
## Overview

This project provides an in-depth analysis of traffic accident data sourced from Kaggle. The objective is to identify key patterns that influence traffic accidents, including:

Road conditions
Weather conditions
Time of day
Accident severity
Key Features
Visualization of accidents by hour, day of the week, and weather conditions.

Insights into correlations between accident severity and visibility, weather, or road features.

Severity of Accidents: The majority of accidents were of low severity, with a smaller number of high-severity accidents.

Weather Conditions: The most common weather conditions during accidents were clear or partly cloudy skies, followed by rainy conditions.

Time of Day: Accidents were most common during the daytime hours, with a peak during the late afternoon.

Relationship between Temperature and Severity: The scatterplot showed a weak correlation between temperature and accident severity, with some evidence of more severe accidents at higher temperatures.
State-wise Distribution: The bar chart showed that some states had a higher number of accidents, which could be due to various factors such as population density, road conditions, or weather patterns.

These findings can be useful for policymakers, transportation officials, and insurance companies to identify areas of concern and develop strategies to reduce the number and severity of accidents.
